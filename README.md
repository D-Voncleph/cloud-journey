# My Cloud Journey

This repository serves as a personal guide to my learning journey with cloud computing on AWS. It contains step-by-step documentation for setting up core services and following security best practices.

## 1. Creating a Secure IAM User

This guide walks through the process of creating an IAM user with administrative access, which is a key security best practice to avoid using the root user for daily tasks.

### Steps:

1.  **Navigate to the IAM Service:** Go to the AWS Management Console and search for "IAM."

2.  **Add a New User:** In the IAM dashboard, click "Users" and then "Add users."

3.  **Set User Details:** Give the user a name (e.g., `voncleph-devops`), and check the box to provide console access. Set an autogenerated password and force a password change on the first sign-in.

4.  **Attach an Administrative Policy:** In the permissions section, select "Attach policies directly" and search for `AdministratorAccess`. Check the box next to the policy to grant the user administrative access.

5.  **Create the User:** Review the details and click "Create user." Make sure to download the `.csv` file with the temporary credentials.

## 2. Creating an S3 Bucket

This guide explains how to create a globally unique S3 bucket, which is a fundamental storage service for any project.

### Steps:

1.  **Navigate to the S3 Service:** Go to the AWS Management Console and search for "S3."

2.  **Create a Bucket:** Click the "Create bucket" button.

3.  **Configure the Bucket:** Choose a globally unique name for your bucket (e.g., `voncleph-first-bucket`), and keep the default settings for now, which block public access.

4.  **Upload a File:** Click on the bucket name to enter the bucket's page and upload a test file to it.
