# Step-by-Step Guide: Launching and Connecting to an EC2 Instance

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of the process of creating and connecting to a virtual server (EC2 instance) on AWS. It covers best practices for instance configuration and secure access.

## 1. Create and Secure Your Key Pair ðŸ”‘

The first step is to generate an SSH key pair on your local machine, which is a more secure way to authenticate than using a password.

1.  Open your terminal on your local machine.
2.  Run the following command to generate a new key pair:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/my-ec2-key
    ```
3.  When prompted for a passphrase, you can press **Enter** twice to leave it empty for now. This command creates a private key (`my-ec2-key`) and a public key (`my-ec2-key.pub`).

4.  Before launching your instance, go to the **EC2 dashboard** in the AWS console.
5.  On the left-hand menu, under "Network & Security," click **"Key pairs."**
6.  Click the **"Import key pair"** button. Give it the same name you used (`my-ec2-key`), and upload the **`my-ec2-key.pub`** file from your `~/.ssh/` directory.

## 2. Launch the EC2 Instance ðŸš€

Now, you will use the AWS Management Console to launch your virtual server.

1.  Go back to the EC2 dashboard and click the **"Launch instance"** button.

2.  **Name:** Give your instance a professional name (e.g., `MyFinanceTracker-Web-Server-1`).

3.  **AMI (Application and OS Images):** Select a stable, long-term support version, such as **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.

4.  **Instance type:** Choose **`t3.micro`**, which is a Free Tier eligible instance type.

5.  **Key pair:** Select **`my-ec2-key`** from the dropdown menu.

6.  **Network settings:** Create a new security group that allows traffic on **SSH (Port 22)** and **HTTP (Port 80)** from "Anywhere."

7.  Click the **"Launch instance"** button.

## 3. Connect to the Instance via SSH ðŸ’»

Once your instance is running, you can connect to it from your local terminal.

1.  Go back to the EC2 dashboard and find the **Public IPv4 address** for your new instance.

2.  In your local terminal, set the correct permissions on your private key:
    ```bash
    chmod 400 ~/.ssh/my-ec2-key
    ```

3.  Connect to your instance using the default `ubuntu` username and the public IP address:
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-ec2-key ubuntu@<your-instance-public-ip>
    ```
